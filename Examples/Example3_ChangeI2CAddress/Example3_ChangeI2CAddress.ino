  An I2C based RFID tag scanner.

  Feel like supporting our work? Buy a board from SparkFun!

  This example demonstrates how to change the I2C address via software.

  Note: To change the address you can also close the on-board jumper. This will force the address to 124 (0x7C).

  Note: If you change the address to something unknown you can either close the jumper (goes to address 0x7C) or
  use the I2C scanner sketch (Example 4).

//byte rfidAddress = 0x7C; //Address when "ADDR" Jumper is closed.  
byte newAddress = 0x67; // Must be 0x08 <= newAddress <= 0x77

void setup(void)
{
  Wire.begin();
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("SparkFun Qwiic RFID Change Address Example");

  // The new address must be 0x08 <= address <= 0x77
  if(changeRFIDAddress(rfidAddress, newAddress) == true) // Old address, new address
  {
    rfidAddress = newAddress;
    Serial.println("Address successfully changed to 0x" + String(rfidAddress, HEX));
  }

  Wire.write(newAddress); // Go to the new address
  if (Wire.endTransmission() != 0)
